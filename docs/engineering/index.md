# Software Development

## Agile development principles:

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.

## User stories

We need to break our work into simple stories that describe what the user's world must look like.

:::note User Story

Who: **As a** registered user

What: **I want to** change my password

Why: **So I can** keep my account secure.
